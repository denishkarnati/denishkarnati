#understanding LOOCV with knn classifier
## Applying LOO for evaluating the performance of a knn classifier on diabetesTask.This calculates the performance matrices, confusion matrix, model accuracy and error rates when trained using LOOCV
LOO <- makeResampleDesc(method = "LOO")

# Use LOO for resampling without stratification
LOOCV <- resample(learner = knn, task = diabetesTask, resampling = LOO,
                  measures = list(mmce, acc))

LOOCV$aggr

calculateConfusionMatrix(LOOCV$pred, relative = TRUE)

#makeResampleDesc(method = "LOO", stratify = TRUE)

#makeResampleDesc(method = "LOO", reps = 5)

# both will result in an error as LOO cross-validation cannot
# be stratified or repeated
